# Section 1: My Journey Begins - Introduction & AWS Account Setup

<img src="diagrams/section01.png">

Welcome to my notes for Section 1! This is the starting line for my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam preparation. The goal here was to get familiar with the course structure and, most importantly, to get my hands dirty by setting up my very own AWS account. I'm writing this in the first person to solidify my own understanding of the concepts.

### 1. What Am I Getting Into? The Course Overview

My journey starts with understanding what this course is all about. It's designed to prepare me for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** exam.

-   **Who is this for?** The instructor, Stephane Maarek, made it clear that I don't need a deep IT background. He explains everything from the ground up, which is perfect for a beginner like me.
-   **What will I learn?** The course will cover over 40 of the most important AWS services. Considering AWS has over 200 services, this seems like a focused and manageable approach.
-   **How will I learn?** This isn't just about watching videos. The course uses a "learning by doing" method. This means I'll be following along with practical, hands-on labs inside my own AWS account. This mix of theory and practice is exactly what I need to make the knowledge stick.

### 2. Understanding the Exam and "Distractors"

The instructor showed a sample exam question to give me a feel for what's coming. The question was: *"Which AWS service would simplify the migration of a database to AWS?"*

The correct answer was "Database Migration Service (DMS)," which makes sense by its name. However, the other options are what he called **"distractors."**

-   **What is a distractor?** A distractor is an incorrect answer choice on the exam that might look plausible. It could be a real AWS service, but one that's not relevant to the question.
-   **Why is this important?** The course will focus on teaching me the core services that I *need* to know for the exam. It won't waste time explaining every single distractor. My job is to learn the right services so well that I can easily spot the ones that don't fit the scenario.

### 3. The AWS Certification Path

I learned that the Cloud Practitioner is the first step on a larger ladder of AWS certifications. Understanding this helps me plan my future career goals.

The path is broken down into four levels:
1.  **Foundational:** This is where I am right now with the Cloud Practitioner. It's all about the fundamental concepts of the AWS cloud.
2.  **Associate:** This level is more role-based. Popular certifications here include Solutions Architect, Developer, and SysOps Administrator. This is a likely next step for me after I pass my exam.
3.  **Professional:** This is for deep expertise, with certifications like Solutions Architect - Professional and DevOps Engineer - Professional.
4.  **Specialty:** These certifications focus on specific, advanced domains like Security, Networking, and Machine Learning.

### 4. Will This Cost Me Money? Understanding AWS Credits

This was a big question for me. I don't want to end up with a surprise bill! Here's the breakdown of how costs are handled for this course:

-   **AWS Free Credits:** When I create a new account, AWS gives me about $100 in free credits to start. This is like a gift card for using their services.
-   **Free Plan vs. Paid Plan:**
    -   **Free Plan:** This is the one I chose. I don't have to provide a credit card for billing (though I do for identity verification). If I use up all my free credits, my account is simply closed. This is the **safest option for learning** because I can't accidentally spend money.
    -   **Paid Plan:** This is for real-world, production applications. I would link a credit card for billing, and if I go over my free credits, my card gets charged. I will avoid this for now.
-   **The Bottom Line:** For this course, following the lectures and labs should be completely covered by the free credits. It's a risk-free environment to learn and experiment.

### 5. How I Created My AWS Account (Step-by-Step)

This was the main hands-on activity for this section. I followed these exact steps to get my account up and running.

1.  **Start the Process:** I went to the AWS website and clicked "Create an AWS Account."
2.  **Root User Email & Account Name:**
    -   **What:** I entered my personal email address. This becomes the "root user," which is the master key to my entire AWS account. It has complete control.
    -   **Why:** This email is the primary identifier for login and account recovery. I also gave my account a unique, friendly name.
3.  **Set a Strong Password:** I created a password that met the security requirements (at least 8 characters, with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). I've stored this password somewhere very safe because losing it would be a huge problem.
4.  **Choose the "Free" Account Plan:** This was the crucial step to ensure I don't get charged. I selected the "Free" plan, which protects me from spending beyond my initial credits.
5.  **Enter Contact Information:** I filled out my personal details as required.
6.  **Provide Credit Card for Verification:**
    -   **Why?** Even for the free plan, AWS needs a credit card to verify my identity and prevent fraud.
    -   **How it works:** They place a temporary hold of about $1 on the card to make sure it's valid, and then this charge is refunded right away. **No actual charge will be made for services** unless I manually upgrade to a paid plan later.
7.  **Confirm Identity with Phone Number:** I entered my phone number and received a verification code via SMS to prove I'm a real person.
8.  **Choose a Support Plan:** I was prompted to select a support plan. I chose **"Basic Support"** because it's completely free.
9.  **Complete Signup and Log In:** After completing the signup, I received an email confirming my account was being activated. I then logged into the AWS Management Console using my root user email and the password I created. I am now ready for the next section!

### 6. What If My Account Isn't Activated? Troubleshooting

Account activation is usually quick (a few minutes), but the instructor noted it can sometimes take up to 24 hours. If I were stuck, here are the steps I would take:

1.  **Check for a Confirmation Email:** The first thing is to look for the "Welcome to AWS" email.
2.  **Finish the Sign-Up Process:** Maybe I closed a window too early. I can go back to the registration portal to ensure all steps are complete.
3.  **Check Payment Method:** I'd double-check that the credit card information I entered was correct.
4.  **Contact AWS Support:** If all else fails after 24 hours, I can go to the Support Center on the AWS website and create a case to ask for help with account activation.

### 7. Section 1: Practice MCQs

Here are some scenario-based questions I've created to test my understanding of this section's content.

**Question 1:**
A colleague is hesitant to sign up for an AWS account for training because they are afraid of unexpected costs. What is the primary reason AWS asks for a credit card during the setup of a "Free" plan?

- a) To charge for the first month of services in advance.

- b) To verify the user's identity and prevent fraudulent accounts.

- c) To automatically upgrade the account to a paid plan after 30 days.

- d) To bill for AWS Basic Support.


**Question 2:**
You are setting up a new AWS account and are creating a password for your root user. Which of the following are best practices you should follow? (Select TWO)

**MCQ Answers:**
1.  **b)** The credit card is for identity verification, not for billing on a free plan.

2.  **b) & d)** A strong password is required, and it must be kept secure. Sharing root credentials is a major security risk.

3.  **c)** The key benefit of the free plan for learning is that the account is closed if credits are exhausted, preventing any real-money charges.

4.  **d)** After the Foundational level, the Associate level is the logical next step.

5.  **b)** The course explains that unfamiliar services in exam options are often "distractors."
