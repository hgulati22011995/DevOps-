Welcome to my notes for Section 1! This is where my AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) journey begins. My goal here was to understand the course structure and set up my own AWS account to start learning practically. I’m writing these notes in my own words to better understand and remember the concepts.

### 1. What Am I Getting Into? The Course Overview

My journey begins with understanding what this course is all about — preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam.
- **Who is it for?** The instructor, Stephane Maarek, explained that no deep IT background is required. He starts from the basics, which is great for beginners like me.
- **What will I learn?** The course focuses on around 40 key AWS services out of 200+, keeping it simple and manageable.
- **How will I learn?** It’s a hands-on course with practical labs in my own AWS account. This mix of theory and real practice helps me truly understand and remember each concept.

### 2. Understanding the Exam and "Distractors"

The instructor showed a sample exam question: "Which AWS service would simplify the migration of a database to AWS?"

The correct answer was Database Migration Service (DMS) — the name itself gives a hint. But the other options were what he called “distractors.”

- **What’s a distractor?** It’s a wrong answer that looks believable. It might be a real AWS service but not the right one for the question.
- **Why does this matter?** The course focuses on key AWS services that I must know for the exam. My goal is to understand them well enough to easily spot when an option doesn’t belong.

### 3. The AWS Certification Path

I learned that the Cloud Practitioner certification is just the starting point in AWS’s certification journey. Knowing the full path helps me plan what to aim for next.

The certification path has four levels:
- **Foundational:** Where I am now — the Cloud Practitioner level. It focuses on the basic AWS cloud concepts.
- **Associate:** Role-based certifications like Solutions Architect, Developer, and SysOps Administrator. This is my likely next step after passing the exam.
- **Professional:** For advanced expertise, with certifications such as Solutions Architect – Professional and DevOps Engineer – Professional.
- **Specialty:** Focuses on specific areas like Security, Networking, or Machine Learning.

### 4. Will This Cost Me Money? Understanding AWS Credits

This was one of my main concerns — I didn’t want to accidentally get charged! Here’s what I learned:

- **AWS Free Credits:** When I create a new AWS account, I get around $100 in free credits to use. It’s like getting a gift card to explore AWS safely.

- **Free Plan vs. Paid Plan:**
  - **Free Plan**: This is what I’m using. I still add a credit card for verification, but AWS won’t charge me. If my free credits run out, the account simply stops — no surprise bills.
  - **Paid Plan:** Used for real-world or production work. Once free credits are gone, AWS starts billing the linked credit card. I’ll avoid this for now.
- **Bottom Line**: All the course labs and demos fit within the free credits, so I can learn and experiment without worrying about costs.

### 5. How I Created My AWS Account (Step-by-Step)

This was the main hands-on task in this section. Here’s how I set up my AWS account from start to finish:

1. **Go to AWS and Start Signup:** I visited the AWS website and clicked “Create an AWS Account.”

2. **Enter Root Email & Account Name:** I used my personal email as the root user (the main account with full control) and gave my account a simple name.

3. **Create a Strong Password:** I made sure it had uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters — and stored it safely.

4. **Select the Free Plan:** I chose the Free plan to avoid charges and stay within the free credits.

5. **Add Contact Information:** I filled in my personal details as requested.

6. **Verify Credit Card:** AWS asks for a card just to confirm identity. They place a temporary $1 hold, which is refunded. There’s no actual charge unless I switch to a paid plan.

7. **Phone Verification:** I entered my number, got an SMS code, and verified it.

8. **Choose Support Plan:** I selected Basic Support, which is free.

9. **Finish Setup and Log In:** After receiving the confirmation email, I logged into the AWS Management Console using my root email and password.

Now my AWS account is fully ready for the next section!

### 6. What If My Account Isn't Activated? Troubleshooting

Account activation is usually quick (a few minutes), but the instructor noted it can sometimes take up to 24 hours. If I were stuck, here are the steps I would take:

1.  **Check for a Confirmation Email:** The first thing is to look for the "Welcome to AWS" email.
2.  **Finish the Sign-Up Process:** Maybe I closed a window too early. I can go back to the registration portal to ensure all steps are complete.
3.  **Check Payment Method:** I'd double-check that the credit card information I entered was correct.
4.  **Contact AWS Support:** If all else fails after 24 hours, I can go to the Support Center on the AWS website and create a case to ask for help with account activation.
